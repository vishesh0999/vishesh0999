# Vishesh Prajapati 👋  
AI Product Manager | Enterprise GenAI & SaaS Products

## About Me

I build **AI products that people actually use**.

I learned this the hard way — watching a technically solid GenAI assistant fail because users didn’t trust it. That moment reshaped how I approach AI product management. I stopped optimizing for demos and started optimizing for **adoption, reliability, and workflows that work on a random Tuesday**.

Over the last 4+ years, I’ve shipped **enterprise GenAI and SaaS products** at Fortune 500 scale, focusing on measurable outcomes instead of novelty.

## What I Work On (Practically)

- Enterprise **GenAI products** with real users (10,000+)
- **LLM-powered systems** designed for trust, not hype
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to reduce hallucinations
- Conversational AI embedded into real workflows
- Product strategy driven by **usage, efficiency, and adoption metrics**

I care more about **daily active users** than model release notes.
