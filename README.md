## 🎯 What I Do

I ship **enterprise GenAI products** that solve the hardest problem in AI: getting people to use them.

Not demo theater. Not proof-of-concepts. Production systems serving **10,000+ daily users** at Fortune 50 scale.

I spent four years learning that anyone can launch an LLM feature. The real product challenge is building RAG architectures that reduce hallucinations by 40%, conversational workflows people don't question, and governance frameworks that let you move fast without breaking compliance.

**Current Focus:** Leading AI product strategy at **The Home Depot** | Building GenAI assistants that improve operational efficiency by 22% | Shipping features that drive 28% adoption growth through trust, not hype

## 💡 Product Philosophy

> **AI products should be judged by adoption and usefulness, not novelty.**

Here's what I've learned shipping production GenAI products:

1. **Trust > Technology** — The best AI features are the ones users don't question. Reliability beats impressive demos.

2. **Workflows > Features** — People don't want AI tools. They want their jobs to be easier. Design for workflows, not capabilities.

3. **Governance = Speed** — Responsible AI isn't compliance theater. It's the infrastructure that lets you move fast without breaking things.

4. **Adoption is the metric** — If your shiny new LLM feature has 5% usage after three months, it's not a product. It's a science project.

5. **Make AI disappear** — The best AI Product Managers make the technology invisible. Users should feel the benefit, not see the model.
