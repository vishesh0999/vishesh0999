## 🎯 What I Do

I build **enterprise GenAI products** that scale from POC to production—serving hundreds of thousands of users, not just impressive demos.

```
Current Mission: Delivering AI-powered conversational assistants at The Home Depot
              serving store associates across 2,000+ retail locations

Product Stack: RAG Architecture • LLMs (Gemini, GPT-4, Claude) • Prompt Engineering
              Semantic Search • Vector Databases • A/B Testing • AI Governance

Track Record: 4+ years shipping products that drive measurable adoption,
             operational efficiency, and business outcomes at Fortune 20 scale
```

## 💡 My Product Philosophy

> **The best AI products are invisible.** They disappear into workflows users trust enough to depend on daily. That requires obsessive focus on accuracy, governance, and solving real problems—not just model performance metrics.

**Core Beliefs:**
- 📊 **Adoption > Innovation** — Ship products users actually use, not features that demo well
- 🎯 **Impact > Complexity** — Business outcomes matter more than technical sophistication  
- 🔒 **Trust > Speed** — Responsible AI and safety guardrails enable sustainable scale
- 🧪 **Data > Opinions** — A/B testing and metrics instrumentation drive product decisions
