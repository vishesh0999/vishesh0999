👋 Hi, I’m Vishesh Prajapati
🤖 AI Product Manager | Generative AI | Enterprise SaaS Platforms

I’m an AI Product Manager based in Chicago, with 4+ years of experience building and scaling enterprise AI and SaaS products across retail and consulting. I specialize in turning Generative AI and LLM capabilities into real, measurable business outcomes—not demos that die in pilot.

I work at the intersection of product strategy, AI systems, and execution, owning roadmaps end-to-end and partnering deeply with engineering, data, UX, and business stakeholders.

🌟 What I Actually Do

🚀 Own GenAI product strategy & roadmaps from discovery → launch → scale
🧠 Build LLM-powered platforms using RAG, semantic search, and agentic workflows
📊 Define success with real metrics (DAU, efficiency lift, resolution accuracy)
🧩 Translate messy business problems into clear PRDs and shipped features
🛡️ Drive Responsible AI with governance, evaluation, and safety guardrails

If it doesn’t improve adoption, efficiency, or decision-making — it doesn’t ship.
